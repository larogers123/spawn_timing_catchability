CompiledMaturityData_HaulsinAssessment_Females.csv
Walleye pollock specimen data from acoustic-trawl surveys conducted by the Midwater Acoustics and Conservation Engineering (MACE) Program at NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center. Data include surveys were conducted from 1983-2021, and subset to only those survey dates that were used to derive estimates of biomass. Specimens were randomly sampled from midwater trawls targetted on acoustic sign. 

maturity: maturity text code, depends on whether 5 or 8 stage maturity key was used.
maturity table: "3" indicates 5 stage key was used; "11" indicates 8 stage key was used
matcode: numeric, corresponds to maturity
mat5stage: all maturity levels recoded to 5 stage key
is_spsp: 0 when not spawning or spent (immature, developing, or prespawning), 1 when spawning or spent
is_mature: 0 when not mature (immature, developing), 1 when mature (prespawning, spawning, spent)
yday: day of year
fork_length: fork length of fish, in cm



MeanVarHatchSpawn_01Sep20_NewAgeLengthREwStn_extendeddates_thru19.csv
Estimates of the start, midpoint, and end of spawning of walleye pollock as estimated from larvae collected during NOAA AFSC EcoFOCI spring larval surveys (1979-2019). Estimates are from Rogers, L.A., and Dougherty, A.B. 2019. Effects of climate and demography on reproductive phenology of a harvested marine fish population. Global Change Biology 25(2): 708â€“720. doi:10.1111/gcb.14483, with updates described in Rogers et al. (in review).

MeanSpawnLR: Day of year of estimated mean date of spawning, as derived from larval otolith data.
VarSpawnLR: Variance of the estimated day of year of spawning
MeanHatchLR: Estimated mean day of larval hatching
MedSpawnLR: Median day of spawning
DurSpawnLR: Duration of the spawning season (95% of spawning in this window)
StartSpawnLR: Day of 2.5th percentile of spawning distribution
EndSpawnLR: Day of 97.5th percentile of spawning distribution
Spawn10LR: Day of 10th percentile of spawning distribution
Spawn20LR: Day of 20th percentile of spawning distribution
