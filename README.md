# spawn_timing_catchability

This repository contains data and code necessary to reproduce the results in Rogers, Monnahan, Williams, Jones & Dorn (in review) Climate-driven changes in spawn timing and availability of walleye pollock to assessment surveys in the Gulf of Alaska.

This study looks at whether changes in spawn timing of Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock (_Gadus chalcogrammus_) relative to the timing of the winter Shelikof acoustic-trawl survey have affected their availability to the survey. We construct catchability covariates based on larval-derived spawn timing estimates as well as observations of spawning status of female pollock collected during the winter acoustic-trawl survey. We then fit state-space stock assessment models using the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM; Stock and Miller 2021) which incorporate these catchability covariates, and find that models with the timing-based catchability covariates provide a better fit to survey data than models without.
